    "\n",
    "- Linearity :\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.\n",
    "This means changes in 𝑌are proportional to changes in 𝑋\n",
    "\n",
    " Checked using: Scatter plot or residuals vs. X plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independence of Errors :\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
    "One observation’s error should not influence another’s.\n",
    "\n",
    " Common issue: Autocorrelation in time-series data.\n",
    " Checked using: Durbin–Watson test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of 𝑋\n",
    "Errors should not fan out or funnel in.\n",
    "\n",
    " Checked using: Residuals vs. fitted values plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normality of Errors :\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "This assumption is especially important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    " Checked using: Histogram, Q–Q plot, or Shapiro–Wilk test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SLR has only one independent variable, multicollinearity is not applicable.\n",
    "(This becomes relevant in multiple linear regression.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero Mean of Errors:\n",
